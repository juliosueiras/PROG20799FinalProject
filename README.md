Final Project of PROG20799

Requirement:

1. The project shall use one of the following data structures:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Queues
    - Stacks
    - Trees
    - Graphs

2. Develop an Inventory Management System in C language. The application should be menu
driven. The application should be able to perform the following operations:
    - Add new item into the inventory.
    - Edit an existing item, based on Item ID.
    - Delete an existing item from inventory, based on Item ID.
    - Search for an item, based on Item ID or Item Name.
    - The items should store the following information in the data structures.
        - Item ID
        - Item Name
        - Item Price
        - Item Quantity

3. The code shall be commented according to the following requirements:
    - Each function shall have a comment with the principal author of the code and a short
    description of what the code is doing.
    - The code (inside functions) shall be commented to explain WHY the code is there (not
            how, not what) wherever necessary.

4. Work assignments:
    - Each function shall have only one author out of the group. ***“We all worked on it
    together”*** is not acceptable as that would never happen in a professional team project.
    As a team you collaborate but each team member must take ownership and
    responsibility of a piece of the code. You will be graded individually based on your
    contribution.
